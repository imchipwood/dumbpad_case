# Dumbpad Case

based off the original design by Anthony @ [customkbd.com.au](http://customkbd.com.au/) - huge thanks to him for his initial work and sending me the STL files I used to create a batch through Shapeways

## Changes from Anthony's design

Main difference is some tabs added in the corners to support the PCB a little better.

I found the original design flexed quite a bit, especially when pressing the rotary encoder. This design aims to fix that.

## Redesigned using SketchUp because

1. I suck at any other 3d modeling software
1. I've used it before
1. It was literally quicker to redraw the whole thing in SketchUp than try to learn a new tool.
