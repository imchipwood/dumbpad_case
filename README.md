# Dumbpad Case

based off the original design by Anthony @ customkbd.com.au - huge thanks to him for sending me the files.

Redesigned using SketchUp because

1. I suck at any other 3d modeling software
1. I've used it before
1. It was literally quicker to redraw the whole thing in SketchUp than try to learn a new tool.
